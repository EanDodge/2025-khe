# Haxophone
## By: Ben Leber and Ean Dodge
- Ben was in charge of the p5.js implementation with javaScript
- Ean was in charge of the React/HTML structure of the program.

## Purpose of the Project
- Purchasing (let alone renting) a saxophone is expensive. You know what isn't as expensive? A keyboard!
- We wanted to create a fun education tool that would be able to teach users how to play the instrument, utilizing music notation and sight reading notes as they pass by.
- With the goal in mind of expanding the user's musical talent, we tried our very best to represent it in this project.

## Tools Utilized
- p5.js
- React
- javaScript
- GitHub

## Issues During Development
- We came across a couple of problems, such as the repository giving us a multitude of issues, but we were able to effectively branch our partitions and work independently, together!
- Unfortunately though, one of the biggest issues we ran into during development was incorporating p5.js with react, which was like mixing water with oil: simply did not work.
